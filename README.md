This is my attempt at recreating and practicing the tecniques of Neural Networks and Monte-Carlo Tree search to solve a game.
The final goal is a chess_bot but HexaPawn will have to suffice
My code follows closely the code written by Dominik Klein in his book "Neural Networks for Chess" which is inspired by the Alpha-Zero papers by Deepmind
Although a lot of my code is similar to his, I try to make it my own everywhere I can and a theme of this project for me as you will get to know is symmetry
